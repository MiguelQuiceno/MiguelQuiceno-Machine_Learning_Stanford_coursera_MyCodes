I've made this for those persons that are stuck in the programming assigments of the coursera course Machine Learning by Stanford University and Andrew Ng.

This repo Contains:
-
* All the programming excercices of the course(with the documentation of each one).

* All the lectures of Andrew Ng.

* The certificate of completition of the course.


Feel free to study the codes and play with it for getting more confidance and make future proyects.
